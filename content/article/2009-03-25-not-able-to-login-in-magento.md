**A simple tweak**  
This is a question I was asking every here and there on forums, from
last 2 days but finally got the solution.  
Magneto has a Good security.  
According to this some url are block for admin, so if you are using any
domain name or http://localhost/ then just use the IP address of that
server, in case of localhost just use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost,
Now your Url will look like on Local  
http://127.0.0.1/magnetofolder/index.php/admin  
and on your server.  
http://server\_IP/index.php/admin
