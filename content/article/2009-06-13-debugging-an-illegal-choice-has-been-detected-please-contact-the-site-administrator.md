Creating a custom drupal module is little messy for a early age
developers. But it is fun to play with the drupal API.  
Now a days Im working on a custom drupal 5 registration Form. At first
when I started playing with it seems fun. Then suddenly I encounter with
a very unknown error message which Reads.  
"An illegal choice has been detected. Please contact the site
administrator."  
debugging this error will take much more time if your Form is big, but
there is trick to find the exact error.  
to Debug the code Login as admin and go to the Logs and click n recent
entry logs there you will find due to which field you are getting the
error.
