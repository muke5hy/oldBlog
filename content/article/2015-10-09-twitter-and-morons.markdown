        Social Networking Abuse


Twitter is full of trolling, if you are on twitter/facebook or any other social platform you must have encountered it. 
Wikipedia says 

	In Internet slang, a troll (/ˈtroʊl/, /ˈtrɒl/) is a person who sows discord on the Internet by starting arguments or upsetting people, by posting inflammatory,[1] extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a newsgroup, forum, chat room, or blog) with the deliberate intent of provoking readers into an emotional response[2] or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion,[3] often for their own amusement.

But what if a person really wants to know something and then other guy starts abusing? 

Yesturday I was checking my timeline and I saw [@rodinhood][rodin_tweet] tweet. He must have intented pun here. But I was not able to understand at first.

Since now I have unfollowed and then he blocked me, I have no where to ask him, why he did that. 

Hence  Mr. Alok Kejriwal can you please let me know who gave you authority to abuse me.
