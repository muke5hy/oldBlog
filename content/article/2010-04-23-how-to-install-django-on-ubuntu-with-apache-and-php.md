Was just going through python in morning and thought lets try out Django
Framework. Django is very popular web framework for python, Its MVC
pattern. So just wanted to give a try to django. I have lappy I have
ubuntu 9.04 installed and as I'm PHP developer I have already installed
apache and php.

To install on Django on your current apache2 just follow the following
commands.

    sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-python python-django python-django-doc

Now open this file in vim or gedit

    sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/django-example

and add these lines

    <Location "/">
        SetHandler python-program
        PythonHandler django.core.handlers.modpython
        PythonDebug On
        PythonPath "['/usr/share/doc/python-django-doc'] + sys.path"
        SetEnv DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE examples.settings
    </Location>

Now disable your default setting

    sudo a2dissite default

Now enable Django exampleÂ  and then reload the apcahe2

    sudo a2ensite django-example
    sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

You can toggle between PHP and Django Now to use php again

    sudo a2dissite django-example
    sudo a2ensite default
