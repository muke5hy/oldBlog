Today I just login in my Gmail account and saw one small link below
filters. This link is nothing but a Google one more feature.  Google
chat integration in Gmail was one of the fabulous project.  
Lets just talk about the "Task" the new feature will be very useful for
a person like me :).  I have very weak memory so it will help me a lot.  
Google's Task is also loaded with a drag an drop feature.
