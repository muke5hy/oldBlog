developers. But it is fun to play with the drupal API.&lt;br /&gt;
Now a days Im working on a custom drupal 5 registration Form. At first
when I started playing with it seems fun. Then suddenly I encounter with
a very unknown error message which Reads.&lt;br /&gt;
"An illegal choice has been detected. Please contact the site
administrator."&lt;br /&gt;
debugging this error will take much more time if your Form is big, but
there is trick to find the exact error.&lt;br /&gt;
to Debug the code Login as admin and go to the Logs and click n recent
entry logs there you will find due to which field you are getting the
error.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="drupal"></category><category term="php"></category></entry></feed>
